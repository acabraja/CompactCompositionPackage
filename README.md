Compact Composition Package
=========================

Problem is on of problems in category optimum stacking packages. Weight of this problem is  possibility of choices elements. For all elements  element may be selected or not. This is 0-1 problem which is NP hard already in 2D. Additionaly problem in this project is 3D problem stacking packages.

Description:
====================
We have a box which has 3 dimension and a lot of small package. Two dimension of box are fixed and one is infinite, packages only fixed dimensions.  We must stacking   packages in box so that packages take a minimum of spaces in box.

For solving this NP problem I using some heuristic methods like genetic alghoritm and some algorithms for clustering.
